# Real-Estate-Data-Analysis

Hello Data Professionals!

🏙️ Just completed a data analysis project on the Dubai Real Estate Market — here’s what I discovered 👇

Using real property data, I explored market patterns, developer trends, and investment opportunities to better understand how pricing, property types, and locations shape real estate decisions.

📊 Key areas I analyzed:
* Property distribution by bedrooms, price range, and developer share
* Pricing insights across villas, apartments, and studios
* Trends across urban, suburban, and rural regions

🧠 Insights included:
1.Which property types dominate market value
2. How location impacts price per square foot
3. Developer specialization and listing behavior
4. Investment-worthy listings with renovation potential

🔧 Tools Used: Power BI, Google colab, Excel
